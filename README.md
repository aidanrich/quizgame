# quizgame

## Description

- The goal was to create a quiz game that would test our knowledge of JavaScript.
- It was especially important that the quiz game load dynamically on the page. As each question is answered a new question appears.
- This activity once again challanged us to figure out what's possible with JS, and added in concepts like local storage and the DOM.
